## About me!
😄 Pronouns are he/they

💻 I'm an architect focused on **C#/.NET** development!

🏛️ I have experience coding for **architecture, engineering and construction** projects!

🏗️ I have done QA/QC for 10.000m² civil engineering and transport projects; using BIM automation, model checking and Autodesk's APIs.

🌱 I am expanding my knowledge into the intersection between architecture and computing: graphical programming, digital twins, visualisation.

⚡ Fun fact: architects are born and raised on projects. If you need someone that can look things from a completely different perspective, collaborate with stakeholders from completely different fields every day, and solve complex problems in no time: look no further!
